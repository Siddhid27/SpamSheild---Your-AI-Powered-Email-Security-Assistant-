# SpamSheild---Your-AI-Powered-Email-Security-Assistant-

🚀 Project Alert: SpamShield — Your AI-Powered Email Security Assistant!

As part of my internship, I created **SpamShield**, a Streamlit-based application that connects securely to your Gmail inbox and analyzes emails in real-time.

✅ It detects SPAM using a machine learning model trained on real-world email data  
🔐 It also scans for PHISHING threats using suspicious phrases & link patterns  
📊 A mini dashboard summarizes all email threats (spam %, phishing %, totals)

🔧 Tech Stack:
- Python + Streamlit
- scikit-learn (ML)
- IMAP (for email fetching)
- Regex + heuristics (phishing detection)

🔑 How it works:
1. You enable **2-Step Verification** for Gmail  
2. Generate a one-time **App Password**  
3. Use that in the app to connect and analyze your inbox
- Secure Gmail API integration
- How spam & phishing differ and how to detect both
- Building intuitive UI/UX using Streamlit

SpamShield is fast, easy to use, and explainable. You even see the **keywords** that triggered detection!
